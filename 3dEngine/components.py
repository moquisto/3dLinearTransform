    #I think I will just manually create my components using math and loops.
    #Nvm, this can be done with rect() from pg




        #pg.draw.rect(self.screen, "red", pg.Rect(30, 30, 60, 840), 1) #.rect takes surface, color, rectangle specifics and line thickness. Default value on last param is 0 ->
        #the entire rectangle is filled in. Otherwise we get only the trace lines. pg.Rect takes x value, y value, wicth and height, starting from top-left corner.
